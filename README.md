# GEM-BCC: GPU-External-Memory Biconnected Components on GPUs


GEM-BCC is an **out-of-memory**, **GPU-accelerated** algorithm for computing **biconnected components (BCC)** on massive graphs that exceed GPU memory capacity. This work was accepted at **Euro-Par 2025**.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **CUDA Toolkit** ≥ 11.0  
- **NVIDIA GPU** with Compute Capability ≥ 6.0  
- **CMake** ≥ 3.10  
- **GCC** ≥ 7.0  
- **Linux** environment (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake
````

---

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhijeetkumar96/External-BCC-for-GPU.git
cd External-BCC-for-GPU
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

---

## Usage

```bash
# Edge-list input:
./build/External_BCC -i /path/to/graph.txt -e <batch_size>

# ECL binary input:
./build/External_BCC -i /path/to/graph.bin -e <batch_size>
```

* **Edge-list format**:

  ```
  n m
  u1 v1
  u2 v2
  …
  um vm
  ```

  (where `n` = number of vertices, `m` = number of edges)

* **ECL format** (binary):
  The executable reads two arrays (`vertices[]`, `edges[]`) as generated by `tools/edgelist_to_bin`. No manual parsing needed—see `tools/edgelist_to_bin --help`.
